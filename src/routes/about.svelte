		My name is Michael and I am an Aerospace Engineer by education, (English language) teacher and educator by
		ardour, and a Software Engineer by vocation. Active in the Scrimba community where I share my love for code and
		learning. I was born in Ukraine 🇺🇦 (it's north of Black Sea), lived all around the UK 🇬🇧 and am currently in
		Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 (it's even cooler than the flag! don't tell anyone 🤫), developer at
		<a href="https://www.huddle.com/" target="_blank">Huddle</a>
		and a factotum at
		<a href="https://scrimba.com/" target="_blank">Scrimba</a>.

		<i>“A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.”</i>
		is a cliche that describes me pretty well, although I generally prefer to add
		<i>'A master of one is a connector of none'</i>.

		"Alan Mynah" is a pseudonym, where 'Alan' is after
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sillitoe" target="_blank">Alan Sillitoe</a>
		and 'Mynah' is because
		<a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/mynah-birds-as-pets-3975149" target="_blank">myna birds</a>
		are awesome.
	</p>

	<p>It's also much easier to spell than 'Rybintsev'.</p>
